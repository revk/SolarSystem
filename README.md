## Back end management cloud system

Cloud back end for management of devices without the need for on-site controller. Runs on linux with mariadb and apache.

An instance of the cloud management system is run on [access.me.uk](https://access.me.uk/) by Andrews & Arnold Ltd, and provisioned DESFire cards can be ordered printed to your design.

Some assembled boards can be ordered from [A&A](https://www.aa.net.uk/etc/circuit-boards/)
